  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am a very passionate student looking to further his skils in school. I love learning new style of art that can benefit me in the future or just expand on my creativity.
  I care about making new things with new ways of art. I can be in any style or form. Art to me is a way of expression or passion towards anything an artist makes. I am one of those
artist who take their time with making something new in order to get ahead or learn something. San Jose State Student and proud to be here because to far I have learn so much
in the semester of being in all my art requirment classes. I learn from my failures of what can I improve on and make it better. I love art because even a failure can look like
like a master piece. </p>
  <p> When approching any kind of artwork. I make sure that it will be something that will keep me busy and grab my attention. Even if it doesnt require a lot of time and effort
  I will still put my time and skills into making it what I want it too Look like. The outcome of my work really depends for me, especially when i can get a comment or two of how im doing.
I can honestly say when I recieve comments it does help even if it hurts my heart a little(haha). All jokes aside it does help out a lot when I recieve comments. My work is suppost to be a way f expression.
Once my work is complete in class I do enjoy the cretiques. Looking at others work before mine is presents gives me a chance to look at what I did and see if I can make changes to make it more polished.</p>
<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>This is My final work and what has come to be from everything I learn to create a remake from my second project. I recreated a video were my inspiration came from my struggle on creating a video.
I want to make a good video and the best thing I could think of was a motivation video. When the idea came to me I wanted to be relaxing where the view can just watch and listen.
The way I see it is flower and motivational speechers do the trick. So I gathered many video of people giving motivational speeches and cliped them all together with my video's of flowers blooming timelapse.
I saw a spark in my creativitiy and began working. After couple of hours into the making I finally had them all together in a long 5 min video, which I hope was enough to show my improvment in the class.
I had a few speekers, who were a little loud but I fixed them along with giving the video a title, and ending it with my name towards the end. This is my Work in Art75. Love this class^_^.</p>
